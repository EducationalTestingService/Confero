UserMonitor Tool Set

** CONTENTS OF FILE ARE CURRENTLY INACCURATE AND NEED UPDATING **

UserMonitor allows an experimenter to capture how a participant interacts with
desktop applications, including those accessed via a web browser interface.
Events generated by the user from a set of input devices are logged, regardless
of the application being used. The screen being viewed by the participant is
recorded and syncronized with the user events being recorded. Supported input
devices include the keyboard, mouse, several eye tracking systems, and others.

In addition to the data collection capabilities mentioned above, UserMonitor
also provides the experimenter with real-time feedback while data is being
collected. The experimenter is able to view the participant's screen, 
event information, and system status via a web browser based UI. The web 
interface also allows remote management of the data collection process.

To start UserMonitor (assuming the software has already been configured, see
the User Manual for details) :

1) First launch the UserMonitor Feedback and Control Server on the computer
it will be running on. This can be started by running the UserMonitorFeedback.bat
file. Be sure to note the LAN address given to access the servers UI.

2) Now start the UserMonitor Data Collection Service by running the 
UserDataMonitor.bat on the computer the participant will be using during the 
experiment.

3) Start the UserMonitor Feedback and Control web based UI by openning a
supported web brower from a computer other than the one being used by the
participant. (Chrome has been used during development). Enter the full 
LAN address (host ip address and port) provided at the end of step 1) into
the address bar of the browser. For example, http://192.168.1.2:8888 could
be a valid UI address.
